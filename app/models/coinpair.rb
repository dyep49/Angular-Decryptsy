=begin
An arbitrage opportunity exists when it is profitiable to buy on one exchange and sell on another. For example, if the price to buy CoinA on Exchange1 is $10 and the price to sell CoinA on Exchange2 is $15, then an arbitrage opportunity exists. This method is used to identify arbitrage opportunities, and return the maximum quantity that can be bought and what profit will be made.

At a high level, the following steps have to be taken:
1. Identical coinpairs on different exchanges are identified
2. To see if an arbitrage opportunity exists, the lowest ask price and the highest bid price are identified.
3. If the minimum ask is less than the maximum bid after fees, then calculate the breakeven price and check to see if there are multiple orders that could fulfill the arbitrage criteria   
4.
