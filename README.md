##Levels of Resistance Explained

Cryptocurrencies with low market caps are frequently pump and dumped. People organize via Twitter and all agree to buy a specific currency at a specific time. At this time, massive influx of buys will often raise the price of a coin by 100%+ within a minute. This "pump" is quickly followed by a "dump" as those initial buyers sell the pumped currency at an artifically inflated price. However, the catch is that there are a number of insiders collaborating with the Twitter organizers who purchase this coin before the pump is set to start. Then, once the pump officially starts, these people dump their coins on non outsiders. In the end, it's typically only insiders that make a consistent profit on a pump and dump.

But, by calculating resistance levels, it's possible to predict which coins will be pumped beforehand. In general, pump organizers will choose a coin that has a very low level of resistance. A currency like Bitcoin would require millions of dollars worth of buys to double its pirce. However, a smaller coin might require only hundreds of dollars to double the price. Unsurprisingly, these pump organizers will choose the smaller coin. 

Using this table of resistance levels, one can purchase the currencies with the lowest level of resistance, set sell orders at about 50-75% of their original purchase price, and far more often than not, these orders will execute for an easy profit.
